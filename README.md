### Site Goals

Ethical Gearz is a Business to Consumer (B2C) e-commerce site that sells ethical hacking software, tools and equipment.

We are excited to introduce Ethical Gearz - an ecommerce store catering to individuals and organizations interested in cybersecurity and ethical hacking. Our primary goal is to provide a range of ethical hacking products suitable for hackers of all levels, at different price points, all in one place. Our aim is to create a platform for people interested in ethical hacking, which aligns with the principles of responsible hacking and contributes to the development of the cybersecurity community. With a strong focus on responsible and ethical hacking, we strive to provide a safe and reliable space for our customers to purchase the necessary tools and equipment for their ethical hacking projects.

As cybersecurity threats continue to increase, and more businesses are becoming targets, the need for ethical hacking has become more important than ever. Ethical Gearz seeks to provide a platform that promotes the ethical use of hacking tools and equipment, raises awareness about cybersecurity issues, and educates customers on how to stay safe and secure online.

### Marketing Strategies

"Ethical Gearz advocates for responsible and ethical hacking practices."

As a result, our marketing strategy is focused on creating a community of like-minded individuals and organizations who share this belief.

Our goal is to establish Ethical Gearz as a reliable source of ethical hacking tools and resources, as well as to build a platform where ethical hackers of all levels can connect, share knowledge and experiences, and collaborate on ethical hacking projects.

To accomplish this, we will employ a combination of digital marketing tactics and targeted outreach to engage our target audience and establish a strong brand identity, which are outlined below:

**Educational content:** Create and publish content that educates the audience about the importance of ethical hacking and cybersecurity. This can include blog posts, social media posts, and videos that provide information about the latest security threats and ethical hacking techniques.

**Social media:** Utilize social media platforms such as Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook to connect with the cybersecurity community and promote Ethical Gearz as a reliable source for ethical hacking tools and resources.

**Referral program:** Offer a referral program to incentivize customers to share their positive experiences with Ethical Gearz with their friends and colleagues. This can help to expand the customer base and build trust in the brand.

**Partnerships:** Partner with ethical hacking and cybersecurity influencers, bloggers, and organizations to reach a wider audience and gain credibility in the industry.

**Ethical messaging:** Emphasize the ethical aspect of the business in all marketing efforts. Use messaging that highlights the importance of responsible hacking and the role Ethical Gearz plays in promoting ethical hacking practices.

**Discounts and promotions:** Offer discounts and promotions on ethical hacking products and services to attract customers and build loyalty.

**Customer reviews:** Encourage customers to leave reviews on the website and other review platforms to build social proof and credibility in the industry.

To promote responsible and ethical hacking, we will implement a marketing strategy that will make use of various digital marketing channels.
This includes SEO to increase the visibility and reach of our website, content marketing to provide useful information and resources to our target audience, social media marketing to engage with our followers and promote our brand, and email marketing with Mailchimp to keep our subscribers up to date on our latest products and promotions.
We hope to establish Ethical Gearz as a reliable source of ethical hacking tools and resources, as well as to contribute to the growth of the cybersecurity community, by utilizing these marketing channels.

### Agile Planning

The project was developed using agile practices, with small features delivered in incremental sprints over a 5 week period. Issues were organized into milestones and prioritized using labels such as "must have," "should have," "could have," and "nice to have."

These milestones were divided into sprints based on six milestones, with "must have" stories being completed first, followed by "should have" stories, and finally "could have" and "nice to have" stories. This prioritization ensured that all essential requirements were completed first, providing a solid foundation for the application and allowing for the addition of must-have features.

GitHub Projects was used to create a Kanban board, which can be found [here](https://github.com/users/mickymacirl/projects/3/views/1). Each story, such as the documentation milestones, is an issue. Each story contains a description of the relevant acceptance criteria that must be fulfilled. There is a "won't do" option for any features that are not implemented.

### Defensive Application

Defensive Application programming techniques were utilized in the development of this website to ensure that only authorized administrators were given access to sensitive features. This was done to prevent unauthorized access and ensure the integrity of user data. Appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms were put in place as part of these techniques. By doing so, the website was made more secure and less vulnerable to potential security breaches.
