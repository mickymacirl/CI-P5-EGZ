Ethical Gearz

Ethical Gearz is a full ecommerce site that specializes in selling top-of-the-line hacking gear to customers around the world. The site is built using Django, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and utilizes Stripe as its payment processor.

This was my fifth project for the Code Institute's [Full Stack Software Development Diploma](https://codeinstitute.net/ie/full-stack-software-development-diploma/).

### Site Goals

Ethical Gearz is a Business to Consumer (B2C) e-commerce site that sells ethical hacking software, tools and equipment.

The site's primary audience is made up of individuals and organizations with an interest in cybersecurity and ethical hacking. Ethical Gearz aims to provide a range of products suitable for ethical hackers of all levels, from beginners to experts, at different price points. The site will enable customers to purchase all the necessary tools and equipment for their ethical hacking projects in one place. The aim is to create a platform for people interested in ethical hacking, which aligns with the principles of responsible hacking, and can contribute to the development of the cybersecurity community.

As cybersecurity threats continue to increase, and more businesses are becoming targets, the need for ethical hacking has become more important than ever. Ethical Gearz seeks to provide a platform that promotes the ethical use of hacking tools and equipment, raises awareness about cybersecurity issues, and educates customers on how to stay safe and secure online.

### Agile Planning

The project was developed using agile practices, with small features delivered in incremental sprints over a two-month period. Issues were organized into milestones and prioritized using labels such as "must have," "should have," "could have," and "nice to have."

These milestones were divided into sprints based on six milestones, with "must have" stories being completed first, followed by "should have" stories, and finally "could have" and "nice to have" stories. This prioritization ensured that all essential requirements were completed first, providing a solid foundation for the application and allowing for the addition of must-have features.

GitHub Projects was used to create a Kanban board, which can be found [here](https://github.com/users/mickymacirl/projects/3/views/1). Each story, such as the documentation milestones, is an issue. Each story contains a description of the relevant acceptance criteria that must be fulfilled. There is a "won't do" option for any features that are not implemented.

### Defensive Application

Defensive Application programming techniques were utilized in the development of this website to ensure that only authorized administrators were given access to sensitive features. This was done to prevent unauthorized access and ensure the integrity of user data. Appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms were put in place as part of these techniques. By doing so, the website was made more secure and less vulnerable to potential security breaches.
