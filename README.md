## Strategy Plane

### Site Goals

Ethical Gearz website is a Business to Consumer (B2C) e-commerce site that sells ethical hacking software, tools and equipment.

We are excited to introduce Ethical Gearz - an ecommerce store catering to individuals and organizations interested in cybersecurity and ethical hacking. Our primary goal is to provide a range of ethical hacking products suitable for hackers of all levels, at different price points, all in one place.

With a strong focus on responsible and ethical hacking, we strive to provide a safe and reliable space for our customers to purchase the necessary tools and equipment for their ethical hacking projects.

To promote responsible and ethical hacking, we will implement a marketing strategy that will make use of various digital marketing channels.

This includes SEO to increase the visibility and reach of our website, brand awareness and recognition, content marketing to provide useful information and resources to our target audience, social media marketing to engage with our followers and promote our brand, and email marketing with Mailchimp to keep our subscribers up to date on our latest products and promotions.

We hope to establish Ethical Gearz as a reliable source of ethical hacking tools and resources, as well as to contribute to the growth of the cybersecurity community, by utilizing these marketing channels.

#### Brand Awareness

#### Search Engine Optimization

## Agile Planning

The project was developed using agile practices, with small features delivered in incremental sprints over a 5 week period. Issues were organized into milestones and prioritized using labels such as "must have," "should have," and "nice to have."

These milestones were divided into sprints based on six milestones, with "must have" stories being completed first, followed by "should have" stories, and finally "nice to have" stories. This prioritization ensured that all essential requirements were completed first, providing a solid foundation for the application and allowing for the addition of must-have features.

GitHub Projects was used to create a Kanban board, which can be found [here](https://github.com/users/mickymacirl/projects/3/views/1). Each story, such as the documentation milestones, is an issue. Each story contains a description of the relevant acceptance criteria that must be fulfilled. There is a "won't do" option for any features that are not implemented.

![Kanban](./docs/readme/kanbanboardrm.jpg)

### Milestones

This project has 7 main Milestones:

1. Basic Setup

    >The basic setup milestone contains all of the stories needed for the ecommerce site’s initial setup. The ecommerce site wouldn't be feasible without the basic setup, so it was the initial milestone to be produced since all other functionalities are dependent on the successful completion of the basic setup.

2. Stand Alone Pages Setup

    >The standalone pages milestone is for comparatively tiny pages with insufficient stories to justify a full milestone. Rather than generating milestones for minimal features like error pages, these minimal features were categorized under this milestone.

3. Authentication Setup

    >The authentication milestone includes all stories concerning registration, login, and authentication. This milestone is critical and important because otherwise, the ecommerce site's administrators would be unable to manage products or orders securely without normal users having the ability to see and execute administrator commands.

4. Admin Setup

    >The milestone admin setup includes all stories concerning creating, viewing, updating, and deleting products, in addition to managing users, and categories. This makes it simple for administrators to view products, manage products and manage administrator users and categories.

5. Stripe

    >The milestone stripe feature allows an ecommerce site user to purchase a product. This milestone is critical and essential for a user in order to create a shopping page, and purchase a product.

6. Additional Features

    >The milestone additional features allows an ecommerce site creator to add certain features. This milestone is important but not essential for a user to use the site.

7. Documentation

    >This milestone includes all document-related stories and tasks required to document the software development process for the application. It aspires to provide high-quality documentation that aids in the understanding of all stages of development in addition to the information required for running, deploying, and operating the application.
