# User Experience

## Strategy Plane

### Site Goals

Ethical Gearz website is a Business to Consumer (B2C) e-commerce site that sells ethical hacking software, tools and equipment.

We are excited to introduce Ethical Gearz - an ecommerce store catering to individuals and organizations interested in cybersecurity and ethical hacking. Our primary goal is to provide a range of ethical hacking products suitable for hackers of all levels, at different price points, all in one place. Our aim is to create a platform for people interested in ethical hacking, which aligns with the principles of responsible hacking and contributes to the development of the cybersecurity community. With a strong focus on responsible and ethical hacking, we strive to provide a safe and reliable space for our customers to purchase the necessary tools and equipment for their ethical hacking projects.

As cybersecurity threats continue to increase, and more businesses are becoming targets, the need for ethical hacking has become more important than ever. Ethical Gearz seeks to provide a platform that promotes the ethical use of hacking tools and equipment, raises awareness about cybersecurity issues, and educates customers on how to stay safe and secure online.

### Marketing Strategies

**Ethical Gearz advocates for responsible and ethical hacking practices.**

As a result, our marketing strategy is focused on creating a community of like-minded individuals and organizations who share this belief.

Our goal is to establish Ethical Gearz as a reliable source of ethical hacking tools and resources, as well as to build a platform where ethical hackers of all levels can connect, share knowledge and experiences, and collaborate on ethical hacking projects.

To accomplish this, we will employ a combination of digital marketing tactics and targeted outreach to engage our target audience and establish a strong brand identity, which are outlined below:

**Educational content:** Create and publish content that educates the audience about the importance of ethical hacking and cybersecurity. This can include blog posts, social media posts, and videos that provide information about the latest security threats and ethical hacking techniques.

**Social media:** Utilize social media platforms such as Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook to connect with the cybersecurity community and promote Ethical Gearz as a reliable source for ethical hacking tools and resources.

**Referral program:** Offer a referral program to incentivize customers to share their positive experiences with Ethical Gearz with their friends and colleagues. This can help to expand the customer base and build trust in the brand.

**Partnerships:** Partner with ethical hacking and cybersecurity influencers, bloggers, and organizations to reach a wider audience and gain credibility in the industry.

**Ethical messaging:** Emphasize the ethical aspect of the business in all marketing efforts. Use messaging that highlights the importance of responsible hacking and the role Ethical Gearz plays in promoting ethical hacking practices.

**Discounts and promotions:** Offer discounts and promotions on ethical hacking products and services to attract customers and build loyalty.

**Customer reviews:** Encourage customers to leave reviews on the website and other review platforms to build social proof and credibility in the industry.

To promote responsible and ethical hacking, we will implement a marketing strategy that will make use of various digital marketing channels.

This includes SEO to increase the visibility and reach of our website, brand awareness and recognition, content marketing to provide useful information and resources to our target audience, social media marketing to engage with our followers and promote our brand, and email marketing with Mailchimp to keep our subscribers up to date on our latest products and promotions.

We hope to establish Ethical Gearz as a reliable source of ethical hacking tools and resources, as well as to contribute to the growth of the cybersecurity community, by utilizing these marketing channels.

#### Brand Awareness

Brand awareness is a key component of our marketing strategy at Ethical Gearz. We aim to establish a strong brand identity by using consistent branding elements such as a professional logo and slogan, and a brand-named domain name. By utilizing these elements across all marketing channels, we hope to increase brand recognition and establish Ethical Gearz as a trusted and reliable source for ethical hacking tools and resources. We will also prioritize customer satisfaction, as positive reviews and word-of-mouth recommendations are essential for building and maintaining a strong brand reputation.

#### Brand Recognition

For our marketing strategy, we will focus on building brand recognition by using a professional logo and slogan and a branded domain name, ethicalgearz.com. This will help to establish our brand identity and make it easier for customers to remember us. We will also ensure that our branding is consistent across all marketing channels to increase recognition and make our brand more memorable.

#### Search Engine Optimization

A key strategy for improving the visibility of Ethical Gearz in search engine results pages is search engine optimization (SEO). One important step in this process was creating a dedicated domain for the website, which is ethicalgearz.com, to improve indexing by search engines. By using ethicalgearz.com as our domain, we will increase the chances of our site appearing higher in search results when users search for keywords related to ethical hacking and cybersecurity. This will help us reach a wider audience and ultimately drive more traffic to the site.

## Agile Planning

The project was developed using agile practices, with small features delivered in incremental sprints over a 5 week period. Issues were organized into milestones and prioritized using labels such as "must have," "should have," "could have," and "nice to have."

These milestones were divided into sprints based on six milestones, with "must have" stories being completed first, followed by "should have" stories, and finally "could have" and "nice to have" stories. This prioritization ensured that all essential requirements were completed first, providing a solid foundation for the application and allowing for the addition of must-have features.

GitHub Projects was used to create a Kanban board, which can be found [here](https://github.com/users/mickymacirl/projects/3/views/1). Each story, such as the documentation milestones, is an issue. Each story contains a description of the relevant acceptance criteria that must be fulfilled. There is a "won't do" option for any features that are not implemented.

### Milestones

This project has 6 main Milestones:

1. Basic Setup

    >The basic setup milestone contains all of the stories needed for the ecommerce siteâ€™s initial setup. The ecommerce site wouldn't be feasible without the basic setup, so it was the initial milestone to be produced since all other functionalities are dependent on the successful completion of the basic setup.

2. Stand Alone Pages Setup

    >The standalone pages milestone is for comparatively tiny pages with insufficient stories to justify a full milestone. Rather than generating milestones for minimal features like error pages, these minimal features were categorized under this milestone.

3. Authentication Setup

    >The authentication milestone includes all stories concerning registration, login, and authentication. This milestone is critical and important because otherwise, the ecommerce site's administrators would be unable to manage products or orders securely without normal users having the ability to see and execute administrator commands.

4. Admin Setup

    >The milestone admin setup includes all stories concerning creating, viewing, updating, and deleting products, in addition to managing users, and categories. This makes it simple for administrators to view products, manage products and manage administrator users and categories.

5. Stripe

    >The milestone stripe feature allows an ecommerce site user to purchase a product. This milestone is critical and essential for a user in order to create a shopping page, and purchase a product.

6. Additional Features

    >The milestone additional features allows an ecommerce site creator to add certain feature. This milestone is important but not essential for a user to use the site.

7. Documentation

    >This milestone includes all document-related stories and tasks required to document the software development process for the application. It aspires to provide high-quality documentation that aids in the understanding of all stages of development in addition to the information required for running, deploying, and operating the application.
